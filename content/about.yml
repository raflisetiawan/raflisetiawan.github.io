  Hi, I'm **Rafli Setiawan**, a Full Stack Developer from Indonesia. I recently graduated from **Universitas Internasional Semen Indonesia** with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics, achieving a GPA of 3.33/4.00.

  My journey in web development started during my university years, and I've since gained hands-on experience through internships and professional work. I'm passionate about building web applications that are not just functional, but also scalable and maintainable.

  ### My Tech Stack

  I work with a variety of modern technologies:

  - **Backend**: Laravel, Node.js (Express.js, NestJS), Go
  - **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js
  - **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite
  - **Tools**: Git, Docker, Postman, VS Code, Figma

  ### Professional Experience

  Currently, I'm working as a **Frontend Developer at PT. AZ Logistic**, where I develop and maintain web interfaces using Next.js, building modules like User Management, My Voucher, and My Subscription.

  Previously, I completed a **Fullstack Developer Internship at PT Semen Indonesia Tbk.**, where I developed a Knowledge Management & Innovation System using Laravel, implementing authentication, role-based access, and automated ranking features.

  ### What Drives Me

  I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems through code. I enjoy the entire process of building applications—from database design to API development to creating responsive user interfaces. Clean code and good architecture are values I always strive for.
